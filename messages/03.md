Hello Peter, what's happening?

We have sort of a problem here.
You apparently didn't put one of the new cover sheets on your TPS reports.
You see, we're putting the cover sheets on all TPS reports before they go out.
Did you see the memo about this?

If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, that would be great.

And I'll make sure you get another copy of that memo, mmkay?
